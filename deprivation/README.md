# Deprivation by constituency

Once every 4-5 years, MHCLG releases the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) dataset. The IMD contains local level measures of various domains of deprivation, and is used to inform various local & national policies.

The House of Commons Library have mapped the 2019 IMD data to constituencies (data & report [here](https://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/CBP-7327)). Alasdair Rae used the data to make some [great visualisations](http://www.statsmapsnpix.com/2019/11/a-deprivation-by-constituency-chart.html).

This repo contains code to (roughly) recreate Alasdair's visualisations.
